                    In this brochure, I talk about what I like. I love to create content and work with social media. 
                    I like to find creative ways to help brands. My dream is to work in a big company and create important campaigns. 
                    I also like to play video games and watch movies in my free time.

                    I chose to talk about the <strong>Salt Cathedral of Zipaquirá</strong>. It is a very special place near Bogotá. 
                    Inside the mine, everything is made of salt and rock. It is unique in the world. 
                    For me, it is important because it represents the history and faith of my country.

                    He lives in Bogotá. In his free time, he likes to ride his motorcycle and watch Netflix. 
                    He is a hardworking person, but he also likes to go to parties. He is a very good friend.

                    It was a good practice for my career.

                    I wrote about David Ogilvy. He is a legend in advertising. He was born in England.
                    Before he was famous, he was a chef and a salesman. He created the agency <em>Ogilvy & Mather</em>.
                    He said that we must respect the consumer. I like his story because he showed that creativity is very important for brands.

                    This is my Mind Map. It shows the tools I use to learn English and Advertising.
                    I use <strong>YouTube</strong> to search for videos. I use <strong>Notion</strong> to organize my notes.
                    To create content, I use <strong>Canva</strong> and <strong>CapCut</strong>. 
                    Finally, I use social media to share my projects.

                    I talk about leaving the "Comfort Zone" to learn new things. 
                    I also use "Mnemonics" (memory tricks) to remember vocabulary. 
                    It is important to challenge ourselves to improve.

                    I think Media Literacy is very important today. We see a lot of information on the internet.
                    We need to analyze if the news is true or fake ("Fake News"). 
                    As an advertiser, I need to understand persuasion to create honest campaigns.
