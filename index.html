                    In this presentation, I talked about the <strong>Salt Cathedral of Zipaquirá</strong>. 
                    It is a unique place near Bogotá where everything is made of salt and rock.
                    I described its tunnels, statues, and lights. It represents the history and faith of my country.

                <p class="post-text">
                    I wrote a chronicle about David Ogilvy, a legend in the advertising world.
                    I described his life: before being famous, he was a chef and a salesman! 
                    He founded <em>Ogilvy & Mather</em> and taught us that ads must respect the consumer. His story inspires me.

                    Media Literacy is the ability to analyze information critically. 
                    In this entry, I reflect on how important it is to identify "Fake News" and hidden messages in mass media.
                    As an advertiser, I must be ethical and understand persuasion strategies.

                    I wrote a reflection about society and laws. 
                    I discussed different types of crimes, like "White-collar crimes" (business fraud).
                    I believe that punishment should help people rehabilitate to become responsible citizens.
